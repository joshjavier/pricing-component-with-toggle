### What I learned

Completing this challenge with just HTML and CSS is indeed possible. But I wanted to challenge myself even further by making it *accessible*, since "HTML and CSS only" solutions can often be hacky workarounds that pay little consideration towards accessibility.

First, the HTML. In case the external stylesheet fails to load, the user can see both price tags for monthly and annual billing.

It might even be better to initially hide the price toggle component to better manage user expectations re: interactivity.

Then come the CSS. To implement the price toggle component, I moved the Annually and Monthly radio buttons so that they are placed on top of the toggle switch component.




Since this is only a one-pager, another approach I could've done is to use an internal stylesheet so that CSS styles are always loaded. But I'm quite happy since
